## Introduction to Agents

- An agent perceives its environment and acts upon it.  
- Agents are defined by their environment and available actions.  
- They can leverage tools to expand their capabilities.  
- Chatbots with retrieval or browsing abilities are examples of agents.  
- Agents combine reasoning, planning, and tool use.

---

## Why Agents Matter

- Agents can automate workflows that require multiple steps.  
- They integrate perception, planning, and action into cohesive loops.  
- Examples include research assistants, trip planners, and negotiation bots.  
- Agents represent a path toward autonomous, goal-driven AI systems.

## Agent Components

- **Environment**: defines the context in which the agent operates.  
- **Actions**: possible operations available to the agent.  
- **Tools**: extend the agentâ€™s ability to perceive or act.  
- **Planner**: determines how to sequence actions to reach goals.  
- **Feedback loop**: updates decisions based on environment responses.

---

## Tools for Agents

- Tools enhance agents by providing knowledge and capabilities.  
- **Knowledge augmentation** tools retrieve or access data sources.  
- **Capability extension** tools solve inherent model weaknesses, such as calculators.  
- **Write actions** tools allow agents to alter environments, such as sending emails.  
- Tool selection shapes the effectiveness and reliability of agents.

---

## Knowledge Augmentation Tools

- Examples include text retrievers, image retrievers, and SQL executors.  
- Tools can provide access to organizational databases and APIs.  
- Web browsing tools help agents access up-to-date public information.  
- APIs for search, news, and social media extend knowledge coverage.

---

## Capability Extension Tools

- Address inherent model limitations, such as poor arithmetic skills.  
- Simple extensions include calculators, calendars, and unit converters.  
- More advanced tools include code interpreters and LaTeX renderers.  
- External tools can also make unimodal models multimodal.  
- These extensions boost performance with fewer resources than finetuning.

---

## Write Action Tools

- Write actions allow agents to modify their environment.  
- Examples include sending emails, executing SQL updates, or initiating transactions.  
- These actions enable automation of complete workflows.  
- However, write actions increase risks of security breaches or harmful outcomes.  
- Proper safeguards are critical to responsible deployment.

---

## Planning in Agents

- Planning determines how agents sequence tool use to complete tasks.  
- Agents must break complex tasks into subtasks and reason step by step.  
- Planning involves both short-term reasoning and long-term strategy.  
- Common methods include chain-of-thought, self-critique, and structured workflows.  
- Strong planners help reduce compound errors across multiple steps.

---

## Evaluating Agents

- Agents are more complex to evaluate than static models.  
- Evaluations must consider success rates across multi-step tasks.  
- Key risks include compounding errors, increased costs, and higher latency.  
- Safety evaluation is critical for agents with write actions.  
- Human-in-the-loop monitoring may be necessary in early deployments.

## What is an AI System?

+ Foundation models
    - Language models
    - Self-supervision
    - From language models to foundation models
+ From foundation models to AI engineering

---

## What Makes AI Different? 

+ Scale: a maximalist approach
+ Foundation models are becoming capable of more tasks

    - More applications
    - More teams leverage AI's capabilities

+ Foundation models require more data, compute resources, and specialized talent

    - Model as a service

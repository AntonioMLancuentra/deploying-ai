# What is an AI System?

## What is an AI System?

+ Foundation models
    - Language models
    - Self-supervision
    - From language models to foundation models
+ From foundation models to AI engineering

---

## What Makes AI Different? 

+ AI is different because of scale
+ Large Language Models (LLMs) and other Foundation Models (FMs) follow a maximalist approach to creating models: more complex models are trained on more data as more compute and storage become available
+ FMs are becoming capable of more tasks and therefore they are deployed in more applications and more teams leverage their capabilities
+ FMs require more data, compute resources, and specialized talent
+ FMs are delivered as Model-as-a-Service

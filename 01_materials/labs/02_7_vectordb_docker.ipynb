In fact, the subtle variations in vocal renderings between the three songs are the     only true variants within the album, which follows logically given no-one has any misconceptions about     where Azure Ray\\'s bread is buttered.          \"The Love of Two\", the only non-album track, is the most atmospheric, as well as most memorable.  An     incessant vinyl scratch murmurs beneath a subtle vocal tonality reminiscent of Mazzy Star, which, distant     and haunted, provides an excellent equipoise to the visceral production.  A \"Bleed Version\" of the     album-inclusive \"We Are Mice\" rounds out the disc with sparse piano backing and choral vocals that I     swear could only be described as uncannily Sarah McLachlan-esque.  There are no true departures to be     found, merely minor tweaking. Unfortunately, the lyrics still read a bit much like Felicity\\'s diary,     but such a regrettable lyrical acumen can easily be overlooked; this music is tactile at heart. If     the duo can simply up the cerebral factor and maybe add a little spice to the mix, a real statement     could be served up.',\n",
       "   'feels like a hothoused project rather than a painstakingly constructed album-- the vocals are a little lacking in finesse at points, and the wholesale use of pre-existing tracks can lend the thing a feeling of inflexibility. But at its best it\\'s a captivating listen, and an admirable move from a producer who continues to challenge himself after two decades in the game.\"This might be only the beginning,\" says Popp of this project. Fingers crossed.',\n",
       "   'Though most of the tracks have vocals, Renn\\'s voice is buried by the mix.  And while this kind of     indistinct singing may be a legitimate shoe-mo tactic, it doesn\\'t make the album any stronger.          The subtle melodies only occasionally break out of the clouds, and the shambling performance that sounds so     fresh on the \\'big\\' numbers can turn into sludge on the slower ones; and with so many rich instrumentals,     quaint songs like \"The Only Good Thing About Pollution\" just drift off into space.  Which is a shame,     because stronger writing could have made this a gripping record, and not just a gorgeous one.']],\n",

      "- Review Quote: Sensitive young men who avoid sunlight and the gloomy misfit young women who adore them: For all the gasps that greeted Twilight author Stephanie Meyer's recent embrace of indie rock, the parallels between the two are obvious enough. On different scales, each has seen its financial fortunes rise the past few years as well. The music industry's troubles are widely known, but indie's stock continues to climb. Phoenix and Animal Collective are two of the year's breakout bands. Jay-Z endorsed Grizzly Bear. Sonic Youth went on \"Gossip Girl\". As reverse indicators of indie rock's increasing popularity, there's the backlash:Slate recently slamming NPR and praising Creed, or recent underground interest in commercial dead ends like lo-fi and glo-fi.Hollywood has hit up Brooklyn before. New Moon's soundtrack is melancholy and nocturnal, as befits the book where Edward leaves protagonist Bella for her own good, but it repeats some mistakes from past indie OST close-ups. Yeah, of course, indie rock is \"just\" pop music, but the companion CDs to Garden State, and TV shows such as \"The O.C.\", \"Gossip Girl\", and \"Grey's Anatomy\" (all at one time helmed by New Moon music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas) over-emphasized indie's adult-contemporary streak. By contrast, the Slumdog Millionaire, I'm Not There, and Sofia Coppola film soundtracks work partly because they share the same restless disregard for boundaries that indie listeners-- ideally, at least-- aspire toward.Despite being the soundtrack to a young adult drama, the New Moon album alas leans toward the adult contemporary. It's packed with indie-friendly royalty, but hardly anybody here sounds anything better than pleasant. As usual, Thom Yorke fares best: The jittery synth-rock of the Radiohead frontman's \"Hearing Damage\" shows more of the heart he moved to his sleeve this year on gorgeous cover \"All for the Best\", and then an atmospheric outro steals it away again. Grizzly Bear's \"Slow Life\", with Beach House singer Victoria\n",

      "- Review Quote: At the heart of the indie mindset is a profound disconnect between perception and actuality.  The ideal:     D.I.Y. ethics, an emphasis on art above marketability, and a purity of purpose that is resistant to fads and     monetary influence.  The reality: indie bands are receiving six-digit recording advances from major media     conglomerates, and are just as ripe for demographic targeting, strategic media placement, and lifestyle     branding as \"mainstream\" bands.  Indie groups like The Shins, Death Cab for Cutie and Modest Mouse can be     heard on teen dramas, late-night talk shows, and in Target, automobile and fast-food television spots.          More power to them.  I don't posit that the increasing permeability of the membrane between indie and     mainstream is an insidious development; instead, it should be acknowledged in the interest of foiling     nonsensical Puritanism.  While truly market-exempt, homegrown music exists (let's call it indie with a     lowercase \"i\"), it's undeniable that capital-I Indie Music (i.e. music aimed at the charts that is \"indie\"     only in its external mien) is here.  Indie Music is big business, and it's absurd to act like it's still     being run out of someone's garage.  The central paradox is that Indie Bands are marketed as personal     choices that express the consumer's highly specific personality and separation from the herd by grouping     them within, natch, one large and faceless herd-- at least Avril Lavigne makes no bones about being for     the masses.          Enter The Comas, who tread this imbricate middle ground between indie and mainstream.  Teen dramas on the     WB have become a fertile market for Indie Music song placement.  Comas singer Andy Herod has done Death     Cab and The Shins one better by dating Dawson's Creek's Michelle Williams for a couple years, then     writing an album about the relationship and its demise.  Conductor was at least partially banked by     Warner Bros., who released it\n",

      "If you're looking for highly rated albums by emerging indie artists, one standout is **\"Conductor\"** by **The Comas**, which received a score of **8.0** from Pitchfork. This album embodies the complexities of the indie music scene, navigating the space between mainstream appeal and independent authenticity. The review highlights the tension between the ideal of DIY ethics and the reality of significant financial backing from major labels, which is a relevant theme in the current indie landscape. The album is noted for its personal narrative, as it was inspired by frontman Andy Herod's relationship with actress Michelle Williams, making it both relatable and introspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another compilation worth mentioning is **\"Live at KEXP Volume 2,\"** which scored **6.9**. While not by a single emerging artist, this compilation features a diverse range of indie talent, showcasing performances from various artists over the past year. It includes both well-known bands like Death Cab for Cutie and newer acts such as Tapes n Tapes and Band of Horses. This album serves as a snapshot of the indie music scene, appealing to listeners who appreciate a wide array of styles within the genre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although not strictly an album by an emerging artist, the **\"the twilight saga: new moon ost\"** received a score of **5.4**, which does not meet the criteria for a must-listen. However, it does feature contributions from notable indie artists, reflecting the genre's broader cultural integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, \"Conductor\" by The Comas is a must-listen for anyone interested in emerging indie artists, while \"Live at KEXP Volume 2\" offers a great overview of recent indie music trends, albeit as a compilation.\n"

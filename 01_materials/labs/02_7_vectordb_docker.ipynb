       "   'Compilations like this are the reason your \\r     skip button is worn down to a smooth, shiny surface. Generally, radio-generated\\r     discs-- or, for that matter, label compilations and soundtracks-- are broad\\r     enough to attract as many listeners as possible, but if there\\'s something for\\r     everyone, there\\'s also inevitably something that someone will hate. To counter\\r     (if not circumvent) this problem, the compilers of the second volume of Live at KEXP have created a Now That\\'s What I Call Indie\\r     compilation, designed to appeal to as many listeners as possible within a very\\r     strictly delineated category. Drawn from more than 370 in-studio performances\\r     over the last year, Volume 2 seems\\r     targeted to appeal to, for example, people who read Pitchfork but never admit\\r     they do. Within these indie confines, Live\\r     at KEXP Volume 2 proves surprisingly diverse, covering indie rap, indie\\r     rock, indie pop, indie folk, and indie revival all within a 20-song\\r     tracklist. Even though it lacks many luminaries that have appeared on the show,\\r     Volume 2 is adequately representative of the last year or so of indie music. At\\r     the very least, it\\'s a more compelling snapshot than any of the O.C. soundtracks.\\r     What\\'s interesting, and maybe even inspiring, about the approach\\r     to this compilation is its intrinsic, optimistic assumption that its audience\\r     is well-versed and open-minded about music. Volume 2 trusts that a listener who\\r     comes for Death Cab for Cutie or the Decemberists will stay for the fiery\\r     performances by Gang of Four and Sleater-Kinney, or that the Bright Eyes fan\\r     will give Common Market and Skullbot a chance.\\r     The CD includes blog faves like Tapes n Tapes, who perform a\\r     spiky version of \"Insistor\", and Band of Horses, whose heart-on-sleeve\\r     performance of \"The Funeral\" out-emos most emo without actually sounding emo. These\\r     relative newcomers mingle with lifers like the',\n",
       "   'At the heart of the indie mindset is a profound disconnect between perception and actuality.  The ideal:     D.I.Y. ethics, an emphasis on art above marketability, and a purity of purpose that is resistant to fads and     monetary influence.  The reality: indie bands are receiving six-digit recording advances from major media     conglomerates, and are just as ripe for demographic targeting, strategic media placement, and lifestyle     branding as \"mainstream\" bands.  Indie groups like The Shins, Death Cab for Cutie and Modest Mouse can be     heard on teen dramas, late-night talk shows, and in Target, automobile and fast-food television spots.          More power to them.  I don\\'t posit that the increasing permeability of the membrane between indie and     mainstream is an insidious development; instead, it should be acknowledged in the interest of foiling     nonsensical Puritanism.  While truly market-exempt, homegrown music exists (let\\'s call it indie with a     lowercase \"i\"), it\\'s undeniable that capital-I Indie Music (i.e. music aimed at the charts that is \"indie\"     only in its external mien) is here.  Indie Music is big business, and it\\'s absurd to act like it\\'s still     being run out of someone\\'s garage.  The central paradox is that Indie Bands are marketed as personal     choices that express the consumer\\'s highly specific personality and separation from the herd by grouping     them within, natch, one large and faceless herd-- at least Avril Lavigne makes no bones about being for     the masses.          Enter The Comas, who tread this imbricate middle ground between indie and mainstream.  Teen dramas on the     WB have become a fertile market for Indie Music song placement.  Comas singer Andy Herod has done Death     Cab and The Shins one better by dating Dawson\\'s Creek\\'s Michelle Williams for a couple years, then     writing an album about the relationship and its demise.  Conductor was at least partially banked by     Warner Bros., who released it']],\n",
